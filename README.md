# Caught Infrared Handed
Using a passive infrared sensor (PIR) to detect motion, Caught Infrared Handed is a clip-on device that prevents excessive face touching.

## Motivation
People touch their faces on average of 23 times an hour which can spread pathogens into our eyes, noses and mouths. With the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, the device is designed to mitigate infection by monitoring how often we touch our faces and to warn us against doing so. It's applications can be further expanded to be used in areas such as the food industry to help people develop better hygiene or by health professionals to prevent contracting a disease from their work environment.

## Project Details
The device uses a PIR sensor connected to an arduino microcontroller that will set off a buzzer when the user's hand comes too close to their face. The device is designed to be clipped onto a hat with the PIR sensor facing downwards to detect for hand motion. The sensor can be manually tuned for sensitivity to adjust for a threshold distance. The device also has bluetooth capabilities and future iterations will integrate with a phone app to track the number of face touches per day and display trends and offer user suggestions. Circuit, app and prototype details can be found in this repository.
